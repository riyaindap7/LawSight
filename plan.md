# Plan for Correcting Import Paths

1. **Update `next.config.mjs`**:
   - Correct the import path for `v0-user-next.config` to ensure it points to the correct relative location based on the project structure.

2. **Update `components.json`**:
   - Correct the aliases for the following paths:
     - **`"components"`**: Update to the correct path for the components directory.
     - **`"utils"`**: Update to the correct path for the utils file.
     - **`"ui"`**: Update to the correct path for the UI components directory.
     - **`"lib"`**: Update to the correct path for the lib directory.
     - **`"hooks"`**: Update to the correct path for the hooks directory.
