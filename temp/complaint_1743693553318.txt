Yesterday evening, I went to **Greenwood Park** for a walk. I had placed my backpack on a bench near the jogging track while I was stretching. After finishing my routine, I returned to find my backpack missing. It contained my **tablet, a notebook with important notes, my house keys, and my wallet with some cash and ID cards**. I looked around and asked a few people nearby, but no one had seen anything suspicious. The area was moderately crowded at the time. I need to file a complaint so that the authorities can help recover my belongings.
