On April 2, 2025, I was walking home from work around 8:15 PM when I was approached by two individuals near Brookside Avenue, close to the Maplewood bus stop. One of them grabbed my arm while the other demanded my wallet and phone. When I hesitated, the first individual forcibly pulled my bag off my shoulder and pushed me to the ground. They then ran towards a nearby alley and disappeared.

My bag contained my iPhone 13 (black, with a cracked screen on the top right corner), my brown leather wallet with about ₹3,500 in cash, my driver’s license, and a few credit and debit cards. I also had a set of apartment keys and some office documents inside.

The area was dimly lit, but I could see that one of the assailants was wearing a dark hoodie and jeans, while the other had on a black jacket and a cap. Both seemed to be in their early twenties.

I immediately called the police from a nearby shop and reported the incident. I would like to request an official investigation and any assistance in tracking my stolen belongings.
